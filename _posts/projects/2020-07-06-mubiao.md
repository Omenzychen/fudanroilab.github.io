Cooperating with a military, the system detects and stably tracks ships, aircraft, XX and other targets in the sky, sea and other natural background environments in real time from white light and infrared images, and calculates physical information such as target size, speed and orientation based on relevant information. The system contains three functional modules: target detection, target tracking and target physical information acquisition.
