The project is based on machine vision technology, real-time detection of solar panel borders and array edges, combined with other sensing units, real-time identification of pathways between panels and arrays or on a single side of the array, site markers, search array edge determination device and its determination methods, to achieve pathfinding, obstacle avoidance and interface with the array connection point of the feeder robot. Implementing a control system for a connected robot based on machine vision technology, including a processing unit for machine vision and other sensing devices, a travel control unit, a lifting platform control unit, a communication unit, and hardware secrecy and software protection measures.s
