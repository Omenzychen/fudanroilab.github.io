The team has teamed up with Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine (SUTCM) to research the key technology of TCM in the cloud, and developed the Cloud TCM Intelligent Service Robot.It focuses on four diagnostic methods in TCM, with strong Chinese characteristics. Its main functions are facial diagnosis, tongue diagnosis, consultation, pulse diagnosis and TCM online consultation. The system collects video and image information of the face and tongue, and uses advanced image processing and artificial intelligence technology to intelligently interpret facial features (face color, gloss, etc.) and tongue features (tongue color, tongue quality color, thickness of moss, tongue cracks and tongue fat, etc.), and then combines the consultation information and pulse diagnosis information, and finally deduces the physique through the TCM theoretical model, and provide personalized rehabilitation suggestions according to specific conditions. The system breaks through the constraints of traditional medical treatment and has many benefits for disease prevention and rehabilitation.
