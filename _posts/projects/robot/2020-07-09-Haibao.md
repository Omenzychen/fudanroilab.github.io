With the support of Fudan University 211 special project "Haibao robot at the World Expo", the research team successfully developed the Haibao robot at the World Expo, which combines "intelligence" and "brilliance". The robot was successfully exhibited and demonstrated for half a year in the "Shanghai Eco Home", the best urban practice area at the 2010 Shanghai World Expo. The Haibao robot has a small "brain" that mimics the structure of the cerebral cortex and has the ability to develop and learn to recognize different objects.
