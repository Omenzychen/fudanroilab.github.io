With the support of "Key Technology Research of Autonomous Mind Development Robot" (065115017), a key science and technology research project of Shanghai Science and Technology Commission, and "Learning Model Based on Combination of Perception and Cognition of Biological Vision (60571052)", the research group successfully developed the second-generation intelligent robot prototype-Fuwa, which is designed for home, office and venue information services. It is a self-loading, mobile, multi-media, strong computing, fully open robot system, and its most distinctive feature is its intellectual development ability, its "brain program" can constantly learn new skills through interaction with the outside world, just like adults teaching children hand in hand, after a period of human-computer interaction learning, Fuwa can have the following abilities: understanding important commands through the auditory system, perceiving the environment through the visual system, expressing emotion through facial patterns, expressing behavior through motor movements, and achieving autonomous obstacle avoidance and object search in the actual environment through visual and motor coordination.
