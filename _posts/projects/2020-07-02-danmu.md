A set of robot vision assistance system for industrial robot monocular 3D vision guidance is developed, which can rely only on a common CCD camera to achieve the identification of scattered parts in the unstructured environment, spatial positioning, as well as the industrial robot 3D guidance. The system is mainly used for 3D robot guidance of the industrial field of three-dimensional scattered parts of the automatic sorting work. The vision assistance system needs to have good compatibility with the mainstream industrial robot control system and achieve reliable and stable motion control of mainstream industrial robots; it needs to have certain adaptability to different kinds of parts within a certain range in the industrial field.
