For active vision and robotics applications, we study the perception, map construction, and navigation control tasks of autonomous mobile robots based on machine learning, focusing on the following research questions: (1) Image pair-based visual odometry approach; (2) Effective visual feature extraction for navigation tasks; (3) Reinforcement learning approach incorporating deep learning; (4) Input dimensional disaster problem in autonomous mobile robot navigation.
