The development of visual positioning and navigation technology for sweeping robots in home scenarios, including the realization of visual SLAM algorithm; the realization of full coverage of sweeping in the home environment based on visual positioning and navigation technology; the realization of remote control and real-time display of sweeping trajectory and the evaluation of sweeping coverage on APP.
