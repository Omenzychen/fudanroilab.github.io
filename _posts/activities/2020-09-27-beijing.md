The award-winning project "TCM auxiliary diagnosis robot" was also reported by Xinhua News Agency. According to the report, Fudan University's intelligent robotics project combines artificial intelligence and traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), and brings out the TCM auxiliary diagnosis robot "Fudan Xiaohua". The project quantifies TCM diagnostic criteria through deep machine learning and algorithms, allowing the robot to realize TCM face, tongue and pulse diagnosis through four diagnostic methods, as well as providing users with personalized Chinese and Western medical health care monitoring, providing herbal diets, massage, physical therapy, diet and other aspects of feedback content, from diet, work and rest and other aspects of a comprehensive health care recommendations. At present, the intelligent robot developed by Professor Zhang's team has reached the sixth generation, and will continue to promote the remote diagnosis and real-time assistance functions of the medical robot in the future.
